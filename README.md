## Multi-Model Fraud Detection System

A robust, real-time fraud detection platform that combines multiple machine learning architectures â€” XGBoost, Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and Transformers â€” to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions at scale. The system simulates real-world data streams and employs modern MLOps practices for deployment, monitoring, and scalability.

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities in financial transactions by leveraging a multi-model ensemble approach. It integrates both structured (tabular) and unstructured (graph/text) data, ensuring high accuracy and adaptability in dynamic environments.

## Key Features
	â€¢	Real-time Fraud Detection using Apache Kafka & Flink for streaming data ingestion and processing.
	â€¢	Hybrid ML Architecture combining XGBoost, GNN, and Transformer models for superior prediction performance.
	â€¢	Feature Store Integration with Feast to maintain consistent features across training and inference.
	â€¢	Model Drift Monitoring using EvidentlyAI for continuous model health tracking.
	â€¢	Scalable Deployment via Docker and Kubernetes with canary release strategies.
	â€¢	CI/CD Automation using MLflow and GitHub Actions for versioning and seamless updates.

## Model Workflow
	1.	Data Ingestion: Stream transaction data through Kafka topics.
	2.	Data Transformation: Use Flink to process, clean, and aggregate features in real-time.
	3.	Feature Storage: Store consistent features with Feast for training/inference parity.
	4.	Model Training:
	â€¢	XGBoost handles numerical transaction data.
	â€¢	GNN models relational dependencies (e.g., customer-to-customer links).
	â€¢	Transformers capture sequential behavior and temporal trends.
	5.	Model Ensemble: Combine model outputs through a meta-learner for final prediction.
	6.	Monitoring: Track model drift, latency, and accuracy with EvidentlyAI and Grafana dashboards.
